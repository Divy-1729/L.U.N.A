# L.U.N.A (Listening Uniquely, Navigating Audibly)

## Overview
**L.U.N.A**, inspired by Luna Lovegood, is an AI bot designed to create a personalized Spotify playlist based on the user's day. It achieves this by:
1. Analyzing the user's text input about their day to predict their emotional state.
2. Generating a Spotify playlist tailored to their mood using their liked songs.

This project blends **natural language processing (NLP)**, **emotion detection**, and **Spotify's API** to provide an engaging and unique user experience.
